# routing
nextjs has file/page based routing. Every file inside pages/ folder becomes a route and pages/index.tsx/jsx/js/ts becomes the root route. e.g: pages/home.tsx is a route wich renders default exported component inside home.tsx. When you visit localhost:3000/home/ this home.tsx get's rendered. Interesting :thinking:.
